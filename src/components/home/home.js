              <p>My name is Austin Keener. I am 26 years old. I was born and raised in Marietta,
                Georgia. I received my degree in Graphic and Web Design this past March of 2020. I really enjoy what
                technology has to offer, and look forward to contributing to the ever expanding www. </p>
      
              <p>As a hardworking, adaptive, understanding, and thorough creative I have roughly ten years of experience
                helping others in the customer service industry. I currently work as a freelance Graphic Designer and Web
                Developer. I chose to expand my knowledge by attending the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp in 2020. I have a
                professional degree in Graphic and Web Design which has made me proficient in Adobe Illustrator, inDesign, and
                Photoshop. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, and Node. I like to adapt to my work
                environment by tailoring each customer's experience to be unique which means that I incorporate a single
                visual voice using color, type, and imagery, throughout each composition that I create. </p>
